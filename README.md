Code Breaker coursework in Java (Year 1)

This my take on the code breaker game.

How to play the game:
Code Breaker is a single player puzzle game that involves guessing a colour code within a given number of attempts.
After each attempt, the player is told how many colours in the code they got right and if they're in the right place.
However, the player is not told which colours are right, or which ones are in the right place!
